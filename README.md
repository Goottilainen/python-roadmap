# python-roadmap

## 🧮 Mini Project 1: Calculator
My first interactive Python program.  
This calculator performs +, -, *, / and includes error handling for invalid inputs and division by zero.

## 🧠 Phase 2: Control Flow

This phase focuses on decision making and loops in Python.  
It includes conditional statements (`if`, `elif`, `else`), logical operators, and both `for` and `while` loops.  
The final mini-project combines everything into an interactive game.

### 🎮 Guess The Number Game

A small interactive Python game that challenges the player to guess a secret number between 1 and 10.

#### Example output:

*** Guess The Number Game ***
I'm thinking of a number between 1 and 10...

Write your guess: 5
Too low! Try again.

Write your guess: 8
Too high! Try again.

Write your guess: 7
🎉 Correct! The number was 7.
You guessed it in 3 tries.
